Some possible things to do so that i don't forget them

2004-08-27 nberry:
  * fix login weirdness (redirects)
  * fix add images
  * fix rotating images
  * move thumbnails into separate table space to work around
    mysql crappy pre-5.x design

2004-04-30 bweir:
  * add web support for image_category
  * fix login/logout weirdness
	- you can logout even if you're not logged in - should generate error
	- sometimes when you log in you get redirected back to login page
  * history logging
	- add more events such as addImage, editImage (if not already logged)
	- somehow remove duplicate view entries from browser fwd/back buttons
  * viewing non-existant image should generate error message
  * red highlighting of categories w/new images doesn't work for images in
    categories that also have sub-categories
  * maybe make a new main category "User's pics" with subcategories ben's,
    nick's, pete's, etc. kind of like what "Misc" is doing now
  * user icons to go on their profile page
