* (nberry) more code fixes and clean up.

	   displayImage() (resizes images otf) runs a little faster...
	   *note: change displayImage() and showImage() into a single class.

	   added slideshow capability based on session_id's last query

	   fixed email-import.php to read in config.inc values.

	   added a favicon.ico  :)

	   added code for quick theme changing (also allows users to change
	   theme without having to login).

	   changed image/view.php to popup in a new window, makes for quicker browsing

	   adjusted popup window attributes based on "init disp" setting in user prefs

	   added parentPath to image/view.php and made links update window.opener.location

	   w3c certified the CSS themes

2005-03-01 -- 2.41
* (nberry) several fixes... register_globals is still required, but at least the
	   code is going in the direction of phasing that out.

	   install.php (formerly setup.php) will automatically be shown if
	   no config.inc is found.  Improved the install process in install.php

	   Re-enabled search conditions pop-up.  Will probably make this configurable
	   via config.inc.

2005-02-16 -- 2.40
* (nberry) major overhaul.  from what I can tell, everything works as it should

2005-02-15 -- 2.37
* (nberry) register_globals is no longer required!

* (nberry) finished formatting the include files

2005-02-14 -- 2.36
* (nberry) cleaned up setup.php (will probably make this command-line next release)

* (nberry) started the laborious task of putting single quotes around
	   <a href... , <input type=... , etc.

* (nberry) cleaned up *all* hard references to candid.scurvy.net

* (nberry) hella formatting fixes


2005-02-02 -- 2.34
* (nberry) setup initial web-based configurator and function validator.

2005-01-07 -- 2.32
* (nberry) cleaned up a ton of old code

* (nberry) fixed border/shadow effect in default theme.

* (nberry) added [edit] link in parentPath

* (nberry) fixed massEdit problem for users under access level 5 (woohoo!)

2004-12-30 -- 2.30
* (nberry) retired htmltop(), htmltop2(), htmlbottom() and htmlbottom2()
	   to css_top() & css_end().

	   This new template allows for CSS-driven design/layout. YESSS!!!!!

2004-11-15 -- 2.22
* (nberry) changed browse behavior so only to show browseCat()
	   when offset is not set (better for browsing)

* (nberry) cleaned up editImage look to conform to new colors

* (nberry) cleaned up person_add.php to check for existing
	   'fname lname'.

2004-11-11 -- 2.21
* (nberry) added last_comments.php to show the logged in user's
	   last 5 commented images with 5 of their corresponding
	   comments.

2004-09-28 -- 2.20
* (nberry) added user_mms which allows users to auto-upload pictures
	   into a pre-defined category via MMS from their cell phone.

2004-09-23 -- 2.18
* (nberry) created new function, getCategoryList2(), to generate a
	   tree-view of the categories.  Already integrated with
	   adding images (instead of scrolling through that long list)
	   and will probably integrate for a "lite" view of candid
	   in browseCat().

2004-09-21 -- 2.17
* (nberry) added filename field (from original CANDID)

* (nberry) added header Content-Disposition to replace the filename
	   when downloading images (instead of saving as main.php.jpg)
	   and will use the image ID if no filename is found

* (nberry) cleaned up browseImage() look.

* (nberry) if descr in image_info is empty, image_view.php will show
	   the html title as 'Image ID: XXX' (not very exciting, but
	   at least it's better than "")

2004-04-29 -- 2.16
* (bweir)  added image_category for images to be assigned in multiple categories

* (nberry) added .tar.gz (.tgz) and .tar support

* (nberry) fixed compressed file uploads, now directory structure is kept (because of tar's
	   behavior) which fixed a filename issue with zips (ie. same filename used in different
	   directories in a zip, one would win).

2004-04-21 -- 2.14
* (nberry) added PNG support

* (nberry) more re-design work

* (nberry) added last added/viewed & random image for a "splash" page

* (nberry) improved thumbnail creation and sped up importImage function

2004-04-14 -- 2.13
* (nberry) added the ability to post comments (while logged in of course)

* (nberry) removed the dependency of cat_id being set while viewing an image to 
	   build parentPath()

* (nberry) added persistent cookie option under user preferences (almost
	   persistent, 2 years and 2 months) or to expire cookie when browser
	   is closed

* (nberry) added width/height fields in image_info table so the image isn't
	   read twice (first time to get the dimensions, second to display the
	   image) and has sped up viewImage() slightly

2004-04-10 -- 2.12
* (nberry) cleaned up the page links generated when browsing (Page 1 2 3 etc),
	   looks quite a bit better.. followed Yahoo!/AV style. adjusted some
	   formatting issues with the browse function

2004-04-03 -- 2.11
* (nberry) fixed the layout issues with CSS (IE's ability to allow bad CSS
	   sucks!) and made the category image linked to browse the category

2004-04-03 -- 2.10
* (nberry) improved the "mass edit" feature to check each image for the same
	   values.  example: all images are in the same category, acknowledge
	   that and auto-select the option for that category.  The "checkboxes"
	   next to the fields will be left in as an extra precaution for the
	   user

* (nberry) added the additional check when adding people to an image so
	   duplicates do not arise (it's focused on the image_id and the
	   user_id)

2004-04-02 -- 2.09
* (nberry) changed the layout for browsing categories and added the menu on the
	   side as a floating css element.. I don't know if I like it, we'll see
	   after I sleep on it. feel free to make suggestions

2004-03-31 -- 2.08
* (nberry) added the ability to assign thumbnails to categories.  I need to
	   clean up the look and feel, but the capability is there either under
	   an editImage (which will update its parent category) or under
	   editCategory where you can enter in the image_id of an existing image
	   or upload a new one

2004-03-31 -- 2.07
* (nberry) changed viewImage function to display images at a user-defined size
	   with choices between 640x480,800x600,1024x768.  Default is 640x480
	   which also applies to all guest users

2004-03-18 -- 2.06
* (nberry) changed viewImage function to display images at 640x480 initially
	   which allows quicker viewing of images, and still keeps the image in
	   its original size (which can be viewed by clicking on the image).
	   This will soon be a user configurable option under the prefs section

2004-01-17 -- 2.05
* (nberry) added last/next image links when viewing an image in a particular
	   category or from search results (only works for logged in users)

* (nberry) cleaned up add/edit admin menus

* (nberry) changed <TITLE> to show the category name being viewed and if images
	   are shown, then also include a page indicator,
	   ie. "CANDID v2 | My Road Trip - Page 3"

2003-10-19 -- 2.04
* (nberry) added html anchors for after editing images, the page will refresh
	   back to the place of the image that was editted (my numrow & numcol
	   count shows several images, so I'm hoping other quasi-lazy people
	   like me will appreciate this)

* (nberry) added shade border around image on main page

2003-10-04 -- 2.03
* (nberry) improved mass-edit feature to only update fields that have been
	   checked

* (nberry) shows thumbnails of all images in mass-edit mode

2003-10-02 -- 2.02
* (nberry) ability to change the update notice (marking categories red that
	   have been updated in either a day, week or month)

2003-09-29 -- 2.01
* (nberry) ability to adjust name order ("last, first" or "first last")

2003-09-21 -- 2.00
* (nberry) re-written from scratch in PHP

* (nberry) speed improved up to 4x

* (nberry) image data resides within the database for improved security

* (nberry) "mass-edit" feature to perform the same change to several pictures
	   at once

* (nberry) "mass-import" feature to set the same options at once (including
	   image rotation)

* (nberry) auto-refresh to previous page (e.g. after editing an image, refresh
	   back to the page you were at before editing)

* (nberry) improved search ability (combined "Alternate search" and "Search"
	   from the original CANDID to allow sorting of the results based on
	   other search criteria

* (nberry) images can be assigned to categories with sub-categories

* (nberry) uploaded images are now sorted by the date they were uploaded

* (nberry) zip files and individual JPEGs can be uploaded (tar and tar/gz soon
	   to be added)
