How to install CANDIDv2

If you already have the items listed under things you need,
and have already set the DocumentRoot in Apache for CANDIDv2,
go to http://web.address/setup.php for a web-based setup.

Things you need:
 1. Apache w/mod_so
 2. MySQL 3.x or 4.x
 3. PHP 4.3.2 w/GD
 4. Unzip

How to prepare CANDIDv2 with 'Things you need':
 1. Compiling Apache
   a. Download Apache from http://httpd.apache.org
   b. Decompress Apache and compile source
     - ./configure --enable-module=so --enable-module=rewrite --prefix=/usr/local/apache
     - make all install
   c. Edit /usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf, set port to 80
	(unless you want to use port 8080) and add the following:

	NameVirtualHost *
	<VirtualHost *>
	  DocumentRoot /usr/local/candid
	</VirtualHost>

 2. Compiling MySQL
   a. Download MySQL from http://www.mysql.com
   b. Read the INSTALL file, I'm lazy   :)
   c. Copy my.cnf into /etc and modify
     - cp support-files/my-medium.cnf /etc/my.cnf
     - vi /etc/my.cnf
	: set max_allow_packet to 4M
	: set tmpdir to /tmp/
   d. After you have MySQL installed, connect to MySQL as root
     - mysql -u root -p mysql
   e. Grant a user access to the database you're about to create..
     - grant all privileges on candid.* to candid@localhost identified by 'candid';
     - flush privileges;
  
 3. Compiling PHP
   a. Download PHP from http://www.php.net
   b. Decompress PHP and compile source
     - ./configure --with-apxs=/usr/local/apache/bin/apxs \
		   --with-mysql=/usr/local/mysql \
		   --enable-gd --with-jpeg --with-zlib
     - make all install
     - cp php.ini-recommended /usr/local/lib/php.ini
   d. Restart Apache
     - /usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl restart
   e. Modify php.ini
     - vi /usr/local/lib/php.ini
	: set max_execution_time to at least 300
	: set memory_limit to at least 16M
	: set post_max_size to at least 16M
	: set upload_max_filesize to the same as post_max_size
	: set upload_tmp_dir to /tmp
   f. Restart Apache
     - /usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl restart
 4. Unzip
   a. After unzipping the CANDIDv2 source, make sure that the web user (for UNIX, nobody; for Windows, IUSR) owns /path/to/candid/htdocs/incoming

Build CANDIDv2's database by running the following command:
  - cat candid.sql | mysql -u candid -p candid

Pull up this server in a browser, click "login" and use admin/admin for the user/pass
